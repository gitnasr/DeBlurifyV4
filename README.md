# DeBlurify - Enhance Your Old & Blurred Images

DeBlurify is a cross-platform mobile application available on Android and iOS that leverages advanced AI capabilities to enhance and de-blur images, with a specific focus on faces. The application seamlessly integrates with the CodeFormer Model API, expertly maintained by (sczhou/CodeFormer). It's important to note that while we integrate this powerful model API into our backend and application, we do not own the model itself.

## Technologies Used

DeBlurify employs cutting-edge technologies to deliver a seamless and powerful user experience:

- **Frontend:**
  - Developed with the efficiency and flexibility of React, harnessing the power of JavaScript for building the mobile application.
  - Utilized Expo, a framework built on React, to streamline and expedite the production process, ensuring a smooth development workflow.

- **Backend:**
  - Powered by NodeJS, the backend facilitates the integration of the CodeFormer Model API into the application.
  - The API, enriched with various features, includes functionalities such as Anonymous Login, NSFW Detection, Image Description, and Face Detection. These features empower the application owner with tools to effectively manage and classify incoming data as needed.

## How It Works

DeBlurify uses AI algorithms to upscale images and eliminates noise, specifically focusing on enhancing facial features. The integration with the CodeFormer Model API ensures state-of-the-art image processing, providing users with a reliable solution for improving the quality of their old and blurred images.
